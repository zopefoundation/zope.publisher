This package allows you to publish Python objects on the web.  It
has support for plain HTTP/WebDAV clients, web browsers as well as
XML-RPC and FTP clients.  Input and output streams are represented by
request and response objects which allow for easy client interaction
from Python.  The behaviour of the publisher is geared towards WSGI
compatibility.
